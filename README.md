# Home IS
This is a collection of docker-compose files that handles containers start/stop/reload of the various
products that can be use on home information system.

## Entertainment

Full description can be found at 
[README.md](https://github.com/Maskime/media-server/tree/master/entertainment)
file. But basically it's the part that handle all media consumption.

## Server tools

Still needs to write appropriate README.md file for this one.
But basically it's the main part of the IS as it host the https entrypoint, network monitoring and
containers monitoring.

## Dev tools

**Coming soon.** This will host the sonarqube server for development quality gate and other products
that will certainly be needed in a near future.
